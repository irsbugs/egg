# egg

Egg Timer is simple code that has been written in C, Vala and Python.

The code contains three functions which output data to the console terminal. There is nothing returned to the caller of these functions.

The objective is to see if the C or Vala code can be made to expose these functions such that other programming languagues can make calls to them.

The three functions are:
* start_egg_timer
* time_elapsed
* time_remaining
